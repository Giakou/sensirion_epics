# Introduction
Python drivers for Sensirion sensors, which support I2C protocol. 
This library is object-oriented, which allows controlling of multiple Sensirion sensors. If the hexadecimal address of
two or more sensors is the same, they can still be controlled if they are connected to different I2C buses.
